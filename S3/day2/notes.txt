Problem:

1. I have only one HTML file in React, so I have only one route
2. we cannot add multiple html files in react // SPA - single page application- only one HTML
3. React to handle URLs
    -react-router-dom 

    -Components : Navbar, Home, About, Products

How to use React-router-dom 

1. Installation : `npm install react-router-dom@6`
2. wrap our application in BrowserRouter - index.js
    - import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
    - wrap <App/> with <BrowserRouter><App></App></BrowserRouter>


3. Create Routes 
 / :home
 /about : about
 /products : Products
where to create Routes
where do you want to show information







 ENTIRE FLOW
 - install
 - wrap app in Browser Router
 - create Routes and Route
 - Link and useNavigate for going to that page 
 - having dynamic information in a route /:key & read it using useParams 
 - having nested routes 
  <Routes>
    <Route to="" element={<Product />} ></Route>
  </Routes>
