    Problem:

1. I have only one HTML file in React, so I have only one route
2. we cannot add multiple html files in react // SPA - single page application- only one HTML
3. React to handle URLs
    -react-router-dom 

    -Components : How to use React-router-dom 

1. Installation : `npm install react-router-dom@6`
2. wrap our application in BrowserRouter - index.js
    - import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
    - wrap <App/> with <BrowserRouter><App></App></BrowserRouter>


3. Create Routes 
 / :home
 /about : about
 







 ENTIRE FLOW
 - intall
 - wrap app in browser router
 - create routes and route
 - link and useNavigate for going to that page 
 - having dynamic info in a route /:key & read it using useParams 
 - having nested routes 
  <Routes>
    
  </Routes>
